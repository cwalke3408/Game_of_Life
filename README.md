In 1970, mathematician John Horton Conway constructed an automation demostration called the Game of Life.  A grid is construction of cells that may have two states: Died or Alive.  Each cell has 8 neighbors and based off the rules determines if the cell live or dies. 

Rules to determine if the cells will live or die
1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
